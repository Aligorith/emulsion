## General

The names of the actions _are_ case sensitive but the input strings are _not_.

It is valid to specify an empty array like `img_del = []` in which case the action will never be triggered.

A config file with bindings will look like the following.

```toml
dark = false
win_w = 835
win_h = 759
win_x = 109
win_y = 70

[bindings]
anim_play = ["alt+a", "alt+v"]
img_del = ["delete"]
img_fit = ["f"]
img_next = ["d", "right"]
img_orig = ["q"]
img_prev = ["a", "left"]
pan = ["space"]
present_play = ["p"]
present_play_rnd = ["alt+p"]
```

## Modifiers

Modifiers may be specified separated by '+' characters. For example `"ctrl+x"` or `"ctrl+alt+u"`. Spaces are trimmed from each element and so
`" ctrl+ x"` or `"ctrl + alt+u  "` are equally valid.

The following modifiers are valid

- `alt`: The alt key
- `ctrl`: The control key
- `logo`: The Windows key (Windows) or the Command key (MacOS)

## Keys

Everything typeable is supported including unicode characters like `Ã¸`, `Å±`, and `ðŸ’œ`

The following list contains all supported non-typeable keys' names (and some of the typeable ones as well).
